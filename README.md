# Gramat (<b>Gra</b>phics <b>Mat</b>h)

This is a simple graphics math library I started working on for the following
reasons:

1. My own use,
2. My own education,
3. My own entertainment.

It's got very few bells and whistles, and all of it is based inextricably on
32-bit floating point.

## Features
- Two, three, and four-dimensional vectors and square matrices, with a pretty
  complete set of mathematical operators!
- Quaternions for rotation and whatever else they might be useful for!
- Various tranformation and projection functions!
- Some documentation!
- Some unit tests!
