# Gramit

This is a simple graphics math library I started working on for the following
reasons:

1. My own use,
2. My own education,
3. My own entertainment.

It's got very few bells and whistles, and all of it is based inextricably on
32-bit floating point. It's being developed alongside several personal projects
and is very unstable; expect many breaking changes!

## Features
- Two, three, and four-dimensional vectors and square matrices, with a pretty
  complete set of operators!
- Quaternions, for rotation and whatever else they might be useful for!
- A unified angle representation to do away with radians-vs-degrees confusion!
- Assorted tranformation and projection utilities!
- Some documentation!
- Some unit tests!
